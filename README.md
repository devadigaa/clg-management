College Management System
This project is a simple yet efficient College Management System designed to streamline student data management. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing student records. The system consists of a web application that allows students to register and view their marks, and an admin panel for managing student details.

Features:
Student Registration Form: A user-friendly form for students to register their information including name, roll number, contact details, etc.
Student Dashboard: Students can access their marks and other relevant details using their roll number.
Admin Panel: Admins have access to a dashboard where they can:
View a list of all students registered in the system.
Add, edit, or delete student records.
Perform searches and filters to find specific students quickly.
Access statistics and reports on student performance.
